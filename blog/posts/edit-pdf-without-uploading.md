You can edit a PDF in your browser without uploading the file to a server.

Open [BentoPDF's PDF editor](/edit-pdf), pick your file, make your changes, and download the result. The PDF stays on your device. There's no account and no watermark.

But “edit a PDF” can mean a few different things. You might want to change existing text, fill out a form, add a signature, redact something, or just highlight a paragraph. The right tool depends on what you're trying to do.

## Why edit a PDF without uploading it?

Think about the PDFs you normally edit.

Contracts. Bank statements. Tax documents. Forms with your address or ID number.

Those aren't necessarily files you want to upload to a random “free PDF editor.”

With an on-device PDF editor, the file stays on your computer while you're working on it.

You can even check this yourself. Open your browser's developer tools, go to the Network tab, and watch what happens while you edit. The PDF itself doesn't need to be sent to a server.

## How to edit the actual text in a PDF

If you want to change words that are already in the PDF, use [Edit PDF Text](/edit-pdf-text).

1. Open the tool.
2. Drop in your PDF.
3. Click on the text you want to change.
4. Type your changes.
5. Download the edited PDF.

BentoPDF loads the PDF in your browser and does the editing on your device.

This is one of the harder things to do with PDFs because PDF text doesn't work quite like text in a Word document. The PDF is mostly concerned with putting things at particular positions on a page, so changing a sentence can mean figuring out how the surrounding text should move.

It works well for ordinary documents, but PDFs with unusual embedded fonts or very complicated layouts can be trickier. I'd always open the downloaded PDF and check it.

## How to annotate a PDF

If you don't need to change the existing text, annotating a PDF is much simpler.

The [PDF editor](/edit-pdf) lets you add highlights, comments, shapes, stamps, text boxes, and images.

Open the PDF, add your annotations, and download the result.

Again, the editing happens in your browser rather than on a remote server.

## How to fill out a PDF form

There are two common kinds of PDF forms.

If the PDF has actual form fields, open it in [PDF Form Filler](/form-filler) and type into the fields. It handles standard AcroForm fields, and also XFA forms, which are the legacy XML-based format. XFA is worth calling out because Chrome and most other viewers show those files as blank pages, which is why some government forms tell you to open them in Adobe Reader. Firefox and BentoPDF's form filler render them properly.

If it's a scanned or flattened form, there aren't any fields to click. In that case, you can put text boxes over the blank spaces in the [PDF editor](/edit-pdf) and type into them. If you'd rather have real fields, [Create PDF Form](/form-creator) can add them to the document first.

This is especially useful for government and HR forms, which often contain personal information I'd rather not upload somewhere just to fill in a few boxes.

If the PDF is a scan and you actually need to edit the scanned text itself, you'll need OCR first. [BentoPDF's OCR tool](/ocr-pdf) can recognize the text in the document while keeping the processing on your device.

## How to redact a PDF properly

This one is important because putting a black box over text isn't necessarily redaction.

If you draw a rectangle over a name, the original name may still exist underneath it. It might still be selectable, searchable, or extractable.

Proper redaction removes the underlying content.

The [PDF editor](/edit-pdf) has redaction tools that permanently remove the underlying content rather than drawing over it. For documents where you also want to strip metadata or other hidden content, [Sanitize PDF](/sanitize-pdf) can help with that.

There's also a privacy reason to do redaction locally: if you upload the original, unredacted PDF to a redaction service, that service has already received the information you're trying to hide.

## How to sign a PDF without uploading it

[Sign PDF](/sign-pdf) lets you add a drawn, typed, or image signature to a PDF. Place it on the page, resize it, and optionally flatten it so it becomes part of the page instead of an annotation someone can drag away later.

The signature is added on your device, so you don't need to upload the document to a signing service just to place a signature on it.

One thing to keep in mind: adding a signature image to a PDF is not the same thing as applying a cryptographic digital signature. If the recipient needs a signature that can actually be verified, use [Digital Signature](/digital-sign-pdf) instead. It signs the document with an X.509 certificate (PKCS#12 .pfx and .p12, or PEM), which proves who signed it and shows whether anything changed afterwards. You can also add a visible signature block on top of that. The certificate password and private key stay in your browser, same as the PDF.

## Can you edit a PDF offline?

Yes.

There's an easy way to test it: load the editor, turn off Wi-Fi, and edit a PDF.

The PDF processing code runs in your browser using WebAssembly. Once the application has loaded, the actual PDF processing doesn't need a server.

This is also something you can inspect yourself in your browser's developer tools. The website is how you get the software; it doesn't have to be where your PDF gets processed.

If you want to run the whole thing yourself, BentoPDF is [open source and self-hostable](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf). You can run your own instance instead of relying on ours.

## What about scanned PDFs?

A scanned PDF is basically a collection of images.

If you want to change the words in it, an ordinary PDF text editor can't simply edit them because there isn't any text there yet.

You'll need OCR (optical character recognition) to turn the pixels into text.

You can either OCR the PDF first and then edit the resulting text, or, if you're just filling out a scanned form, put text boxes on top of the existing page.

## Is there a file size limit?

There isn't an imposed file-size limit.

The practical limit is your device's available memory. Normal PDFs are usually fine, but a thousand-page scanned archive is a very different workload from a five-page contract.

For very large PDFs, a desktop application may be a better choice.

## Will editing a digitally signed PDF break the signature?

Yes.

Changing a digitally signed PDF will invalidate its existing signature. This isn't specific to BentoPDF; it's a consequence of changing a document that has already been signed.

So the usual order is:

**Edit first. Sign last.**

If you need to make changes to a signed document, make sure you understand the signature requirements before doing so.
