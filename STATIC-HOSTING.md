# Hosting BentoPDF as a static website

As an alternative to running BentoPDF locally or in a Docker container, you can easily host it as a set of static web pages. Here are a few examples:

## Netlify

### Netlify - static deployment

One of the simplest ways to host BentoPDF is to create a project at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and create a static deployment. You can accomplish this by first downloading the pre-built distribution file from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases). Each release includes a `dist-{version}.zip` file that contains all necessary files for self-hosting.

1. Go to [BentoPDF Releases](https://github.com/alam00000/bentopdf/releases)
2. Download the latest `dist-{version}.zip` file
3. Next, if you have not already done so, create a Netlify account and log in.
4. From your Netlify projects page, add a new project and select "Deploy manually".
5. Drag and drop to upload the BentoPDF zip file you downloaded in step 2.
6. Your BentoPDF deployment should now be working! Optionally, you can go into Project Configuration and change the project name.

When a new BentoPDF release becomes available, you will need to repeat steps 1-3, then go into "Deploys" and upload the new release.

### Netlify - dynamic deployment

Alternatively, you can configure a Netlify project to automatically deploy whenever your BentoPDF is updated.

1. If you have not done so already, create a fork of BentoPDF into your own GitHub account.
2. If you have not already done so, create a Netlify account and log in.
3. From your Netlify projects page, add a new project and select 'Import an existing project'.
4. Select the GitHub button, authorize Netlify, then choose where to install the integration. You can choose 'All repositories' or 'Only select repositories' and choose your BentoPDF fork.
5. Select your repo and give it a project name. (add environment variables?) Then click the blue 'Deploy' button.
6. The Netlify build & deploy process will kick off. Once it finishes, you can click on the provided URL `https://[projectname]/netlify.app` to view your deployment of BentoPDF.

Whenever the BentoPDF source code is updated, you can sync the changes into your repo. This will kick off a new build and deploy within Netlify.

If you want to use BentoPDF's simple mode, go into Deploy Settings, then Environment Variables, and Add a variable. Add `SIMPLE_MODE` and set it to `true`. You will need to manually kick a new build to get this to take effect.

## Vercel

Vercel provides similar services to Netlify dynamic hosting.

1. If you have not done so already, create a fork of BentoPDF into your own GitHub account.
2. If you have not already done so, create a Vercel account and log in.
3. From your Vercel Overview page, select 'Add new project'
4. Under 'Import Git Repository' and then choose 'Add GitHub Account'. Follow the prompts to authorize Vercel integration. You can choose 'All repositories' or 'Only select repositories' and choose your BentoPDF fork.
5. Select 'Import' to import the repo into Vercel.
6. Under 'Framework Preset', select 'Vite' and save the settings.
7. The Vercel build & deploy process will kick off. Once it finishes, you can click on the provided link to view your deployment of BentoPDF.

Whenever the BentoPDF source code is updated, you can sync the changes into your repo. This will kick off a new build and deploy within Vercel.

If you want to use BentoPDF's simple mode, go into Project Settings, then Environment Variables, and Create a new variable. Add `SIMPLE_MODE` and set it to `true`. You will need to redeploy to get this to take effect.

## GitHub Pages

You can also host your own instance of BentoPDF using GitHub Pages. An advantage of this over the other options is you are able to do everything in GitHub without any third-party service.

1. If you have not done so already, create a fork of BentoPDF into your own GitHub account.
2. From your fork, go to `Settings->Pages`, and change the 'Source' to 'GitHub Actions'
3. Go to `Settings->Secrets and Variables > Actions`, then select 'Variables', and add the repository variable `BASE_URL`. Set the value to `/bentopdf`. _If you've renamed the repo to something other than bentopdf, put that here_.
4. Go to `Actions` in the top menu, and select 'I understand' to enable Actions
5. Within Actions, on the left, select 'Deploy static content to Pages', and then on the right select 'Run workflow', and in the dropdown, 'Run Workflow'. The action will now run to build BentoPDF and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

When the build completes, you can find the website at `https://[your-github-username]/bentopdf`

If/when you merge changes from the source BentoPDF repository, the build and deploy action will automatically be kicked off and the new version will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

## SEO and search engine indexing

By default, every self-hosted BentoPDF build emits canonical URLs and an
hreflang/`x-default` set that point back to `https://www.bentopdf.com`. This
is intentional for two reasons:

1. **It consolidates SEO signals to the official site** so your instance
   doesn't compete with bentopdf.com on brand searches like "bentopdf".
2. **It keeps your instance off public search results.** If you self-host
   on a small VPS, a home server, or anywhere with limited bandwidth, you
   probably don't want strangers from Google landing on it. With the
   default canonical pointing back to the official site, search engines
   treat your instance as a copy and won't surface it for organic traffic
   and your bandwidth is reserved for the people you actually share the URL
   with.

You have two clean overrides depending on what you want.

### Run your own SEO instance (claim canonical for yourself)

If you operate a public deployment and want it to be the indexed copy for
your audience, set `SITE_URL` at build time to your origin. The build will
emit canonicals, hreflang, and structured data pointing at your domain.

- Docker:
  ```sh
  docker build --build-arg SITE_URL=https://pdf.example.com -t bentopdf-self .
  ```
- Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any other static host: set `SITE_URL`
  in your project's environment variables and re-deploy. The build script
  reads it during `npm run build`.

### Stay invisible to search engines (no SEO competition either way)

Set the runtime environment variable `ROBOTS_NOINDEX=true`. The container
injects `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` into every served
HTML file at startup. The canonical link still points at the official site
by default, so when crawlers do follow internal links they still see
bentopdf.com as the authoritative source.

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e ROBOTS_NOINDEX=true ghcr.io/alam00000/bentopdf:latest
```

You can combine the two: build with your own `SITE_URL` and run with
`ROBOTS_NOINDEX=true` for a private deployment that's neither competing
with bentopdf.com nor advertising itself.

### Note on Simple Mode

Simple Mode (`SIMPLE_MODE=true`) controls the **UI** — it ships a stripped-down
homepage suitable for company intranets and single-purpose deployments. It
does **not** by itself control whether your instance is indexed by search
engines. A public-facing simple-mode deployment is fully indexable by default,
just like the full-mode build. If you want a simple-mode deployment hidden
from search engines, combine `SIMPLE_MODE=true` at build time with
`ROBOTS_NOINDEX=true` at runtime.
